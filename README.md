# ðŸ“˜ Learning R with *The Art of R Programming*

Welcome to my R learning journey!

This repository contains my personal scripts and code examples inspired by the book **"The Art of R Programming"** by **Norman Matloff**. I'm working through the book chapter by chapter to build a strong foundation in R programming.

1. Getting Started  
2. Vectors  
3. Matrices and Arrays  
4. Lists  
5. Data Frames  
6. Factors and Tables  
7. R Programming Structures  
8. Math and Simulations  
9. Object-Oriented Programming  
10. Input/Output  
11. String Manipulation  
12. Graphics  
13. Debugging  
14. Performance Enhancement  
15. Interfacing R to Other Languages  
16. Parallel R  

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

- Practice and master core R programming concepts  
- Document my learning progress  
- Share reproducible examples with others learning R

## ðŸ§  Notes

This repository is updated regularly as I go through the chapters. Contributions or suggestions are welcome!
