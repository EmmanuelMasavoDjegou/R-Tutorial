# ðŸ“˜ Learning R 

Welcome to my R learning journey!

This repository contains my personal scripts and code examples inspired by the book **"The Art of R Programming"** by **Norman Matloff**. I'm working through the book chapter by chapter to build a strong foundation in R programming.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

- Practice and master core R programming concepts  
- Document my learning progress  
- Share reproducible examples with others learning R

## ðŸ§  Notes

This repository is updated regularly as I go through the chapters. Contributions or suggestions are welcome!
